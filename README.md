# Ongoing stage: Design

**Goal**: A set of format's design principles (FDPs)

**Desired duration**: two-three months

## Workflow

Anyone can propose an FDP. See FDP-0 for how-to.

Once all proposed FDPs are managed, the call for the end of the design stage (an open issue in this repository with a notification e-mail from andrey.rybakov@uv.es to everyone) will be made and if no new FDP appear after XX>7 days after the call, then the work will move to the implementation stage.
