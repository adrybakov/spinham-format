# Ongoing stage: Design

**Goal**: A set of format's design principles (FDPs)

**Desired duration**: two-three months

## Workflow

Topical discussions are hosted via [issues](https://github.com/spinham/spinham-format/issues). When a consensus is reached in the issue (or the moment is appropriate) a pull request with the FDP can be opened. See FDP-0 (will appear soon) for how-to.

Once all proposed FDPs and all topical issues are closed, the call for the end of the design stage (an open issue in this repository with a notification e-mail from andrey.rybakov@uv.es to everyone) will be made and if no new FDP appear after XX>7 days after the call, then the work will move to the implementation stage.

Any member can open an issue or propose an FDP.
